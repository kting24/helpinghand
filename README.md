# Helping Hand - SD Hacks

The website was created with the intention of helping people from different areas connect and volunteer to improve the community they are in. They can use the website to create an account and interact with others who have the same goal of volunteering. Additionally, those with an account can access the information in the page and look at events in their area, and for the sake of convenience, rsvp/commit to attending it.
